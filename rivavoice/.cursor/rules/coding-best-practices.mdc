## Coding Best Practices
- **Always do the Occam's Razor as the first consideration for any changes you want to make**, or any fix you want to implement. Make sure you mention Occam's Razor "OCCAM'S RAZOR APPLIED: " in caps.
- **Do not modify code or UI elements that already work**, unless explicitly instructed.
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality; reuse working components whenever possible.
- Write comprehensive tests for all new or modified functionality.
- **Never unintentionally delete data or code**; confirm explicitly before destructive actions.
- Commit frequently to maintain a reliable project history.
- Always ask clarifying questions if tasks or requirements are unclear. When asking a clarification, make sure you write "CLARIFICATION REQUIRED:" in caps.

## User Interface (UI)
- **Never change or affect the UI unintentionally.** Only alter UI components if explicitly instructed or clearly part of the assigned task.
- Always ensure UI changes are fully tested and validated.
